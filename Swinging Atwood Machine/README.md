# Description

This file creates an animation of the swinging atwood machine with mu=M/m=6 and the initial theta position being 90 degrees. It also 
creates a trajectory of the swinging atwood machine for 50 seconds. The left side of the convergence plots created include a normalized 
change in r, change in theta, and change in energy versus change in time. On the right side of the convergence plots are the run times for 
each convergence plot.
