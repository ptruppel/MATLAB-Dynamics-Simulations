The simple pendulum file creates the animation of a simple pendulum swinging. Additionally, the energy versus time is plotted with the 
swinging of the pendulum for its potential, kinetic, and total energy at any given instant in time. A second figure is generated as a plot 
of the degree theta versus time. The solutions using the exact, Eulers method, and ode23 are plotted against eachother on this plot. 

The convergence analysis fule creates a graph of change of theta plotted against the change in time. Then the second graph it creates is 
the change in energy versus the change in time.
