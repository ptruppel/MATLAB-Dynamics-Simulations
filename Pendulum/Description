This MATLAB file creates the animation of a simple pendulum swinging.
Additionally, the energy versus time is plotted with the swinging of the pendulum 
for its potential, kinetic, and total energy at any given instant in time. 
A second figure is generated as a plot of the degree theta versus time. 
The solutions using the exact, Eulers method, and ode23 are plotted against 
eachother on this plot.
