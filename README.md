# MATLAB Dynamics Simulations

This repository is to be a reference for dynamical simulations when using the MATLAB coding language. The codes posted here include convergence analysis for the systems as well. It should be noted that these codes have been given permission to be posted on a public GitHub repository by the instructor of the class where I created these.

## Getting Started

Open up matlab and simply run the codes in order to watch animations and graph generation.

### Prerequisites

MATLAB license.

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running

Say what the step will be

```
Give the example
```

And repeat

```
until finished
```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo

## Running the tests

Explain how to run the automated tests for this system

### Break down into end to end tests

Explain what these tests test and why

```
Give an example
```

### And coding style tests

Explain what these tests test and why

```
Give an example
```

## Deployment

Add additional notes about how to deploy this on a live system
