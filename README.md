# MATLAB Dynamics Simulations

This repository is to be a reference for dynamical simulations when using the MATLAB coding language. The codes posted here include convergence analysis for the systems as well. It should be noted that these codes have been given permission to be posted on a public GitHub repository by the instructor of the class where I created these.

## Getting Started

Open up MATLAB and simply run the codes in order to watch animations and graph generation. Modify the code's inputs as needed.

### Prerequisites

MATLAB license.

## Built With

* [MATLAB](https://www.mathworks.com/products/matlab.html) - The coding environment used
